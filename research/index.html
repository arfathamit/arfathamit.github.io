        <p class="abstract" style="display:none;">Abstract: This paper explores the impacts of transportation infrastructure on U.S. retail markets. The identification strategy relies on variation in historical transportation infrastructure. Using detailed scanner data, I examine the effects of U.S. interstate highways on various aspects of consumer welfare. First, the findings indicate that interstate highways reduce prices and expenditures on retail goods and improve the quality of goods purchased by consumers. Second, interstate highways not only increase the supply of unique products in stores but also the variety of products purchased by consumers. Finally, the analysis reveals that interstate highways reduce the retail price index for both low and high-income consumers. Accounting for the costs of construction and maintenance, counterfactual analyses show that interstate highways enhance consumer welfare.</p>

        <p><a href="javascript:void(0);" class="toggle-abstract">[Abstract]</a></p>
        <p class="abstract" style="display:none;">Abstract: In this paper, I develop regional and income group-specific price indexes by estimating demand functions derived from a model of consumer choice with non-homothetic preferences using detailed barcode-level and household survey data. To illustrate the importance of differences in the cost of living across US households on the real impacts of the federal tax and transfer system, this paper examines a counterfactual policy that adjusts the 2020 stimulus payments based on regional and household group-specific price indices. The results reveal significant variation in the real impact of stimulus payments. For example, to have the same real impact, the nominal value of a stimulus payment to a household in California would need to be about two and a half times the amount as a payment to a household with the same income but living in Arkansas.</p>

        <p><a href="javascript:void(0);" class="toggle-abstract">[Abstract]</a></p>
        <p class="abstract" style="display:none;">Abstract: We show that price uniformity is prevalent within stores and across products of the same brand, termed uniform brand variant pricing. We then study how this impacts input cost pass-through by developing a simple theoretical framework that we use to inform empirical pass-through models. We find that (1) cost pass-through for all inputs is identical across all brand variants, (2) cost pass-through for inputs contained in all brand variants is higher than cost pass-through for inputs used in only a subset of brand variants, and (3) input cost pass-through increases as the share of brand variants containing that input increases.</p>

        Abstract: This paper reviews research on U.S. business tax policy over the past 25 years, a period marked by repeated legislative changes including EGTRRA (2001), JGTRRA (2003), AJCA (2004), TCJA (2017), IRA (2022), and OBBBA (2025). These reforms altered investment incentives, corporate and pass-through taxation, dividend and capital gains rates, international provisions, and enforcement regimes. The resulting variation has allowed scholars to assess how taxes affect business investment, financing, payouts, and labor outcomes. Evidence shows that bonus depreciation reliably accelerated investment, especially for smaller and financially constrained firms, though aggregate effects were often modest. Dividend tax cuts provided mixed support for competing theories of capital taxation, shaping payout composition and asset pricing through heterogeneous channels. The growth of pass-through entities has reshaped income distribution, with preferences largely benefiting high earners and producing limited real activity. The TCJA stands out for lowering the corporate rate, revising international rules, and introducing new place-based and pass-through incentives, though its economic benefits were uneven and often skewed toward shareholders. Across areas, disclosure mandates improved transparency but also induced adaptive avoidance. Overall, business tax reforms yielded important insights into tax incidence, efficiency, and distribution, underscoring the centrality of policy design for shaping firm behavior.

        Abstract: This paper reviews 25 years of U.S. business tax policy, spanning reforms from EGTRRA (2001) to the TCJA (2017) and OBBBA (2025). These changes reshaped incentives for investment, payouts, organizational form, and international activity, while also altering enforcement and reporting rules. Empirical evidence shows that bonus depreciation accelerated investment among smaller and constrained firms but delivered modest aggregate gains. Dividend tax cuts influenced payout composition and asset pricing more than overall investment. The rise of pass-through entities shifted income toward high earners with limited real activity. The TCJA lowered corporate rates and revised international provisions but produced uneven benefits concentrated among shareholders and multinationals. Disclosure initiatives improved transparency yet spurred adaptive avoidance. Taken together, the literature highlights both efficiency and distributional trade-offs, showing that the effects of tax reform depend critically on policy design and its interaction with firm behavior.

        <p><a href="javascript:void(0);" class="toggle-abstract">[Abstract]</a></p>
        <p class="abstract" style="display:none;">Abstract: Consumption taxes have long been favored by tax economists for their relative efficiency compared with taxes on capital and labor. This paper examines the stabilization properties of tax cuts within a DSGE framework. In addition to consumption taxes, the model incorporates other tax instruments, including investment tax credits and changes to expensing and depreciation policies. We provide the first quantitative insights into the size of the multipliers associated with tax cuts that directly target consumption and investment. (Preliminary. Project status: expanding the model.)</p>

        <p class="abstract" style="display:none;">Abstract: We examine how the expansion of digital connectivity has affected international trade, using a new panel dataset for over 100 countries from 2002 to 2019. Our research question asks whether better internet access—both overall broadband and specifically mobile connectivity—stimulates trade flows, with particular attention to services. Methodologically, we employ a structural gravity panel regression with country-pair fixed effects and an instrumental variable strategy that exploits the staggered rollout of mobile broadband networks. The dataset combines GSMA mobile broadband penetration and overall broadband access data with bilateral trade flows from the WTO and World Bank, allowing us to isolate the impact of digital infrastructure on trade. Preliminary results indicate that improved connectivity increases total trade, but the effects are especially pronounced in services sectors such as IT, financial, and business services. The introduction of 3G and 4G networks is associated with a substantial rise in services trade volumes, highlighting how high-speed mobile internet enables new export opportunities. These findings contribute to the literature by showing that digital infrastructure—both overall and mobile—supports greater integration into global markets, with disproportionately large gains in services.</p>
